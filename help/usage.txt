Documentation - Usage

To score a target:
1. Select a target type by clicking one of the tabs on the main screen: NRA A-17 or NRA/USAS-50. The NRA/USAS-50 is optimized for scoring an ORION target.
2. Click Select Image or Open Folder. If you are scanning an NRA A-17 target, please select an image for both sides of the target.
3. Click Analyze Target. Hit any key on the keyboard or click the [X] in the top right to see the next bull. The bulls are displayed in clockwise order, starting with the top-middle bull. The sighter bull(s) in the center are omitted.
4. a. Click File -> Show Output (as long as you scored a single target as opposed to using Open Folder) to see the score.
   b. Click File -> Show in Explorer, then open the data directory, then open data.csv to view scores for targets analyzed using Open Folder.


Data from the analysis is stored in the data folder as data-<Name><Day><Month><Year><Target number>.csv

If "Use info from file" is selected, the program will automatically update the date and target number. This will overwrite all data and target number information in the box already. If the file is not named correctly, or you would like to use a different date or target number, make sure to deselect this option.
For this, you must name the target files as such:
NRA A-17:
<2 number day><3 letter shortened month><Year><left/right><target number>.jpeg
For example:
"03jan2021left1.jpeg" and "03jan2021right1.jpeg"
NRA/USAS-50:
<2 number day><3 letter shortened month><Year><Shooter's name><target number>.jpeg
For example:
"03jan2021Sigmond1.jpeg"

You can click [Use Today] to set today's date and use target #1. The target number allows you to score multiple targets from the same person on the same day.
You can also simply type in a month, day, year, target number, and name.
When using either option, please make sure to disable "Use info from file" in this scenario.

The name should identify the target easily. I prefer to use the shooter's name for this. It is preferable to make the name one word only (Sigmond or SigmondKukla for example) to avoid problems related to the path of files that use this name.

To show identified trends for a single shooter across a range of dates:
1. Click File -> Show Trends.
2. Select Load Folder or Load File, depending on what trend you would like to see:
    a. Load Folder allows you to open the data folder (or another folder with output files in it) to see which bull has the lowest score on average versus the highest score.
    b. Load File allows you to select a CSV data file to see a graph of shooting performance including score and X Count.
Remember, these are designed for a single shooter. Please copy and paste data files / folder to another location to isolate them to score only a single shooter.
