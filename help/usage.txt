To score a target:
1. Click File -> Load left image and select your scanned image for the left side (or click the [Select left image] button at the bottom)
2. Click File -> Load right image and select your scanned image for the right side (or click the [Select right image] button at the bottom)
3. Click File -> Analyze target (or click the [Analyze target] button at the bottom)
4. Click the [X] on the analysis windows to view results for each bull

Data from the analysis is stored in the data folder as data-<Name><Day><Month><Year><Target number>.csv

For each target, you can click [Use Today] to set today's date and use target #1. The target number allows you to score multiple targets from the same person on the same day.
If "Use info from file" is selected, the program will automatically update the date and target number.
For this, you must name the target files as such:
<2 number day><3 letter shortened month><Year><left side or right><target number>.jpeg

For example:
"03jan2021left1.jpeg" and "03jan2021right1.jpeg"
