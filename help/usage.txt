Documentation - Usage

To score a target:
1. Click File -> Load left image and select your scanned image for the left side (or click the [Select left image] button at the bottom)
2. Click File -> Load right image and select your scanned image for the right side (or click the [Select right image] button at the bottom)
3. Click File -> Analyze target (or click the [Analyze target] button at the bottom)
4. Click the [X] on the analysis windows to view results for each bull

Data from the analysis is stored in the data folder as data-<Name><Day><Month><Year><Target number>.csv

Alternatively, click File -> Show Output after analyzing a target to see each bull laid out in their real locations. 
Click the "Open Target CSV" button to open the CSV file for the target. Click the "Open Data CSV" file to open the CSV that contains all scanned targets.
You cannot use File -> Show Output if you analyzed multiple targets using the Open Folder method.

If "Use info from file" is selected, the program will automatically update the date and target number. 
This will overwrite all data and target number information in the box already. 
If the file is not named correctly, or you would like to use a different date or target number, make sure to deselect this option.
For this, you must name the target files as such:
<2 number day><3 letter shortened month><Year><left side or right><target number>.jpeg
For example:
"03jan2021left1.jpeg" and "03jan2021right1.jpeg"

You can click [Use Today] to set today's date and use target #1. The target number allows you to score multiple targets from the same person on the same day. 
When using this option, please make sure to disable "Use info from file" in this scenario.
You can also simply type in a date and target number, but please make sure to disable "Use info from file" in this scenario.

Type in a name that identifies the target. I prefer to use the shooter's name for this. 
It is preferable to make the name one word only (Sigmond or SigmondKukla for example) to avoid problems related to the path of files that use this name.

To score multiple targets:
1. Place all of the scanned targets into the images folder. Do not place any other files with the JPEG extension in the folder right now. 
If necessary, create a subfolder and move the extraneous files to that location.
2. Make sure that all targets are named correctly (as per the example above)
3. Click File -> Open folder and select the images folder
4. Wait until the label at the top of the window reads "Done"
5. To view data for an individual target, open Explorer to the data folder. Then, open any CSV file that is named as such:
    data-<name><day><month><year><target number>.csv
    For example:
    data-Sigmond03January20211.csv
6. To view data for all targets, open the data.csv file in the data folder.

To hide the black command prompt that appears when running this program, rename "gui.py" to "gui.pyw"
