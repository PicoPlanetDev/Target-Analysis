Documentation - Measurements

*Disclaimer: This might not actually be what these rings are called... I'm just going off of what I used in the code.

Measurements used in the target analysis system (radius):
Outer ring   - 46.150 millimeters
Five ring    - 37.670 millimeters
Six ring     - 29.210 millimeters
Seven ring   - 20.750 millimeters
Eight ring   - 12.270 millimeters
Nine ring    - 3.810 millimeters

Scoring spindle on scoring gauge uses radius 2.8 millimeters (equivalent to âŒ€5.6mm)

All of these millimeter values are converted to pixel values through calibration to the detected outer ring of the target.
The target analysis system uses Hough Circles to identify a large circle in the scanned image. If the ratio of the detected ring to the image size is incorrect, the circle will be multiplied to adjust it accordingly.
